This repository showcases the heatmapping program and footage that was captured to test this program.

## Instructions
1. Before running the code, add the videos that you would want to process first into the videos folder.
2. After, in the [code.py](code.py) file, edit line 14 to the video you would want to process.
3. In line 44, edit the value to your liking.
4. Run the code.
5. If you would like to stop the video at any point of time, click the 'q' button.
6. Once your video has finished processing, a file called diff-overlay.jpg will be created with your heatmap.
